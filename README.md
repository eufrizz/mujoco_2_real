# mujoco_2_real

This notebook is designed to get you up and running with some first movements on your robot arm. It will introduce you to the various modes of control in the arm's API, including cartesian and joint control, position and velocity control, inverse kinematics, simulation in MuJoCo, and screw trajectories. This is a condensed version of how I got up to speed on the fundmentals of robot arms, specifically on my Ufactory Lite 6.
